# PROSECAST — STATUS

**Status:** Active
**Updated:** 2026-07-10

## Where it's at
**Chatterbox backend is wired** (CC brief 2026-07-10). The `chatterbox` engine now
exists in `prosecast/tts_engine.py` — no longer just the tag_mapper half:
- `_synthesize_chatterbox()` POSTs to the devnen server `/tts` in clone mode with a
  per-character reference clip, driving `exaggeration`/`cfg_weight`/`speed_factor` from
  `map_tags(tags, "chatterbox")`. Non-200s print the server body (no silent swallow).
- `test_chatterbox_connection()` GETs `/api/model-info` and prints `Connection OK ✓`, plus
  a **LOUD Turbo guard** — the server currently has the *turbo* model loaded, which IGNORES
  exaggeration/cfg, so emotion tags won't affect delivery until Tyler switches to base.
- `CHATTERBOX_VOICES` pool + `VoiceAssigner` branch (narrator=slot 0, round-robin), pool
  repopulated live from `/get_reference_files` at construction; static fallback otherwise.
- Auto-detect priority: ElevenLabs (if key) > chatterbox (if server answers) > piper/say/gtts.
- `tag_mapper._map_chatterbox` finished: emotion-arousal table nudges exaggeration/speed
  (high-arousal up, low-arousal down); `speed` renamed to `speed_factor` at the payload edge.
- Real server contract captured in **`docs/chatterbox-contract.md`** (built from the live
  `/openapi.json` — not the mapper's old assumptions).
- Smoke CLI: **`scripts/chatterbox_smoke.py`** (renders one line to `output/chatterbox_smoke.wav`).
- Tests: **`tests/test_chatterbox.py`** — 12 offline/mocked tests (mapper bounds, pool
  assignment, payload shape incl. the speed→speed_factor rename, Turbo guard). All green;
  no network, no precious data touched.

Prior context: **PRD.md** defines the dogfood MVP (Tyler listens to Parade end-to-end,
multi-voice, on phone). Phases: A) Chatterbox backend + listen test (THE GATE) → B) cast
review screen → C) resumable full-book render → D) listen-through.

## Next step
**Two YELLOW items that need Tyler (his infra / server-state — CC was not allowed to do these):**
1. **Switch the server to base `ResembleAI/chatterbox`** — the Turbo model ignores
   exaggeration/cfg, so emotion tags are inert until this changes. (The connection check
   warns loudly when Turbo is loaded.)
2. **Upload VCTK voices:** `.venv/bin/python scripts/stage_vctk_voices.py --from-dir ./vctk_voices
   --upload-to http://GIDEON_HOST:8101` (only Gianna.wav / Robert.wav exist as references now).

Then run **`.venv/bin/python scripts/chatterbox_smoke.py`** and **LISTEN** — that WAV is the
Phase A gate. (CC did not run the render: the guardrail was GET-only against the server, and
judging audio quality is Tyler's call.)

## Blocked on
Nothing — awaiting Tyler's Phase A listen test (needs the two YELLOW items above first).
(Aside: LLM pass for Yumi/Frankenstein IR still needs Ollama reachable — llm_attributor
defaults to localhost:11434.)

## Backup (2026-06-12)
- **Where:** `NAS_USER@GIDEON_HOST:/mnt/bolt/backups/prosecast/library/` (ZFS dataset `bolt/backups`, owned by NAS_USER)
- **What:** ir.json + voice_map.json + corrections.jsonl per book; renders/ and exports/ excluded (disposable). No `--delete` — local mistakes can't propagate.
- **Re-run:** `./scripts/backup_library.sh` (works from Mac or a Cowork session; log in `.backup/last_backup.log`)
- **Nightly:** `scripts/com.prosecast.backup.plist` → 21:30 daily once installed (see Next step)
- **Auth:** dedicated key `.backup/prosecast_backup_ed25519` (gitignored), registered in NAS_USER's SSH keys as "prosecast-backup (Cowork session key)" — delete that line in TrueNAS UI to revoke
- Initial backup verified 2026-06-12: 61/61 files, checksum-clean, IR readable from server

## Notes
- Run tests after touching attribution layers: `.venv/bin/pytest tests/ -v` (needs spaCy + en_core_web_sm; skips otherwise)
- All book paths via `prosecast/library.py` — `library/<slug>/{ir.json, voice_map.json, corrections.jsonl, renders/}`
- corrections.jsonl is append-only training flywheel data — never rewrite
- renders/ is disposable; everything else in a book dir is Tyler's labor — back it up
- Build queue: cast review screen, pipeline-in-UI jobs, per-chapter narrator dropdown
- Backup gap CLOSED — see Backup section above.
- **Money model shift (2026-07-10):** ProseCast follows the AnimaForge model — free local
  Chatterbox tier is complete; ElevenLabs is optional, **bring-your-own-key** (affiliate, no
  markup, user pays EL directly). No ProseCast-run premium/payment economy near-term; the
  marketplace/royalty/coin research is moonshot-only. Reframed in PRD.md + market-research doc;
  new user guide at `docs/elevenlabs-setup.md`.
